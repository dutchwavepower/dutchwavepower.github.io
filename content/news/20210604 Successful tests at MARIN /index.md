# Validation at MARIN

Over the past two weeks, we have again conducted a series of successful tests at MARIN (Maritime Research Institute Netherlands) during the free basin time for innovative SMEs. Multiple variations of our concept have been tested and validated under a range of regular and irregular wave conditions. The insights gained will accelerate the development of our follow-up prototype, which will soon be deployed in the North Sea.
