# A big thanks
A big thanks to Rob van Gils and Ronald Gideonse of Drive Line Systems BV (DLS) for realizing the drive line for our wave energy converter prototype, which we have tested so successfully at Deltares. Developing and building a completely new drive line free of charge and sharing their enthusiasm, knowledge and hands-on mentality is highly appreciated. This illustrates how cooperation contributes in making Dutch wave energy happen.
