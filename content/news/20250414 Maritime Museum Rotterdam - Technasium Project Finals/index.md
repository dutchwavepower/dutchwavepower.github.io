A huge congratulations to the well-deserving team from Groene Hart Lyceum, winners of the Verolme Trust Technasium Award! As a fantastic reward, their entire class will enjoy surf lessons at RiF010 in the heart of Rotterdam â€“ the city's first urban surf pool!

A round of applause also goes to the impressive runners-up from Northgo College. Their humble yet effective approach, presenting a solution with remarkable clarity, earned them a well-deserved award monthly magazine De Ingenieur from the KIVI - Koninklijk Instituut Van Ingenieurs.
